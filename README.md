Steer the story in the direction you want it to go. Heal injuries, teleport missing pawns back, change backstories that do not fit the narrative.

Pawn Editor is a new editor for your pawns inspired by great mods like Character Editor and Prepare Carefully.

Your last colonist exerts her final breath as she dies. Not even her ultratech armor or archotech implants could save your colony from... a rabbit? Tend to your pawns and shape them in a way that fits the story you had in mind.
